# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-18)

**Core value:** Every behavior the fork adds on top of upstream is pinned by an automated test that passes against ClickHouse `latest` with client V2, so the fork can be changed or rebased without silently breaking production pipelines.
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — Type Mapping, Writer, Helper Client & Config

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (Type Mapping, Writer, Helper Client & Config) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-09-19 — Phase 07 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Milestone-level decisions are locked in `REQUIREMENTS.md` (the "Locked decisions" table) and `PROJECT.md` → Key Decisions. Carried forward because they constrain how work must be done:

- The merge runs on scratch branch `sync/v1.6.0` with a `pre-v1.6.0-sync` tag on the pre-merge tip. `custom_build` is already published — it is only brought forward by a **non-force** merge once green.
- Prefer upstream wherever its implementation passes the fork's tests. The policy does **not** apply to JMX naming (upstream's version fails JMX-01/02) nor to the fork-only dependency pins (ClickHouse client `0.9.6`, Kafka Connect API `4.1.1`).
- Do not interleave `.planning/` commits with in-progress conflict resolution — a commit containing a `<<<<<<<` marker in tracked source is the SYNC-06 failure signal.
- Bug fixes live in the phase whose tests expose them — there is no separate bug-fix phase.
- A main-code change reaching outside a phase's declared scope stops for a user decision. The fork runs in production.
- Type coverage asserts typed SQL read-back, never `countRows`.
- The test JVM runs `file.encoding=windows-1252` on purpose. Any new reader of ClickHouse output must specify UTF-8 explicitly.
- client-v2 `GenericRecord` from a `Records` iterator is a mutable, reused row view — snapshot into a `Map` during iteration.
- New sink-task tests must create their tables before `start()` — `ClickHouseWriter.start()` fails against an empty database.
- [Phase 06]: Landed the 581-commit v1.6.0 merge as one mechanical commit (673d29c3) on scratch branch sync/v1.6.0, tagged from pre-v1.6.0-sync; all 40 conflicted paths verified byte-identical to upstream via a committed invariant script. — D-01/D-02: keeps every fork re-application in Phases 7-10 a reviewable diff against upstream instead of a judgement call inside a 500-file merge.
- [Phase 06]: Phase 06 Plan 02: Re-applied all six fork build.gradle.kts additions (JaCoCo report-only, testUnit + check-exclusion guard, JDK-17 test-JVM launcher + windows-1252 encoding, LZ4 capability resolution, ben-manes dependencyUpdates, Spotless config) onto upstream v1.6.0's version-catalog build file; landed VERSION=v1.6.0_gg1 and the .gitignore/tests.yaml settlement; proved all four D-12 resolved-version facts against the live dependency graph. — Keeps every fork re-application a reviewable diff against upstream, per D-01/D-02; the gate (help+dependencies) is the only pass/fail signal for Phase 6.
- [Phase 06]: [Phase 06]: Phase 06 Plan 03: Generated .planning/MERGE-CHECKLIST.md (40-row Section 1 from conflicted-paths.txt, 8-row Section 2, Recorded Facts closing SYNC-04/SYNC-05); flipped Phase 6's 5 build/infra rows to done; re-proved D-02/SYNC-06 invariants across the full 588-commit range. Corrected a research-prose error about Processing.java's merge status and a plan verify-block premise about merge-commit counts (both documented as deviations, no repo state altered). — Turns the merge's conflict surface into a per-path gate Phases 7-11 flip inside their own commits, with Phase 11 asserting zero pending rows before publication; closes SYNC-03/04/05/06, completing Phase 6's 14 requirements.
- [Phase 07]: Phase 07 Plan 01: Skipped tree-wide spotlessApply (unrelated 52-file reformat since Phase 6 merge); verified the 4 edited files independently pass spotlessCheck instead. — Running spotlessApply would violate the plan's own scope boundary (MUST NOT touch other lines of ClickHouseSinkTask.java) and break its single-hunk-diff acceptance criterion.
- [Phase 07]: Phase 07 Plan 02: Re-threaded targetTableFilter server-side table filtering (config key + buildTableFilterClause + builder wiring) and re-expressed shouldSkipDescribeRow over a loop-local Map<String, Column> since upstream's Table is now immutable; pinned describeTableV2's reader to UTF-8. — D-08/D-16/D-19: keeps every fork re-application a reviewable diff against upstream, matches the locked map-based signature, and closes two of the five silently-vanishing fork behaviours before Phase 11's live audit.
- [Phase 07]: Phase 07 Plan 03: Landed the remaining fork config settings (jsonInsertColumns key, explicit-format flag, async_insert un-forcing) and the planned four-item Phase 10 test carve-out, then discovered and Rule-3-fixed a much larger compile gap: twelve additional fork test files depended on pre-merge ClickHouseBase/ClickHouseTestHelpers methods (createProps/createClient/createTable) the mechanical merge silently dropped, undetected by planning's D-05 blast-radius measurement. — Every redirect targets an already-existing equivalent (getBaseProps, ClickHouseTestHelpers.createClient, a local queryV2-based createTable helper) so D-06 and D-09's locked restrictions on ClickHouseBase/ClickHouseTestHelpers hold exactly as decided; two files (MBeanNameUnitTest.java needs Phase 8's buildMBeanName, ClickHouseTestHarnessTest.java needs Phase 10's shared-container strategy) remain deliberately uncompiled and are flagged as a CRITICAL blocker for plan 07-04's testUnit gate.

### Pending Todos

- `REQUIREMENTS.md`'s header coverage count said 46 v1 requirements; the document actually lists **53**. Corrected in the Traceability block at roadmap creation — no requirement was lost, the summary count was simply wrong.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Env]: This Claude Code shell sets `TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE` to the literal string `"null"`, which breaks Testcontainers' Ryuk reaper. Run Gradle as `env -u TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE ./gradlew ...` (already in `config.json`'s `build_command`/`test_command`). Docker runs on colima profile `vz`.
- [Merge]: ⚠ **Five fork behaviours vanish with no conflict marker and no compile error** unless deliberately re-applied — JMX `connector=<name>`, `async_insert` un-forcing, the UTF-8 `describeTable` readers, `targetTableFilter` + the sub-column skip, and `ClickHouseBase`'s `@Tag`/shared-container/MBean-sweep contract. Each has a named test as its canary (Phases 7, 8, 10).
- [Prod]: ⚠ **Unfixed production bug, pinned only.** R-01: `insertFormat=json` + a `Struct` record + default `bypassRowBinary` silently discards every row. Its keep/drop disposition is Phase 9's blocking-human checkpoint — it must not be decided by accident.
- [Merge]: `ClickHouseTestHelpers.java` is a modify/delete that git resolves by orphaning the fork's copy — post-merge the tree can hold two compiling copies with divergent defaults. Grep for exactly one canonical file (HARN-04, Phase 10).
- [Tooling]: The `gh` CLI is not installed locally (deliberately — D-11), so CI runs are checked through the unauthenticated GitHub REST API (`actions/runs?head_sha=`, `/jobs`, `/artifacts`; 60 req/hr) or the web UI.
- [GSD]: Worktree isolation quirk, dormant but recurring: a plain `gsd_run query dispatch-isolation` read re-persists the sentinel, so any deliberate degrade must be re-forced with `--force-isolation ` immediately before each dispatch.
- [Phase 06]: ⚠ **CR-01, latent — safety-net script fails open.** `.planning/scripts/verify-merge-invariants.sh:44` treats a `git grep` error (exit ≥2) identically to "no match" (exit 1), with stderr suppressed, so Invariant 2 reports clean on a broken pathspec or unreadable commit. The property itself currently holds — re-derived at the Phase 6 security audit with corrected exit-code branching (592 commits, 0 markers, 0 git errors) — but **fix before Phase 11**, which gates publication on this script running unattended. Recorded in `06-SECURITY.md` → Carried Defects.
- [Phase 07 Plan 03]: CRITICAL — compileTestJava still fails on 2 files after this plan: MBeanNameUnitTest.java (needs ProxySinkTask.buildMBeanName, Phase 8) and ClickHouseTestHarnessTest.java (needs ClickHouseBase.sharedContainerStarts()/ClickHouseTestHelpers.query, Phase 10). MBeanNameUnitTest.java does NOT extend ClickHouseBase, so it is not excluded from testUnit by the clickhouse tag — plan 07-04's stated testUnit-green acceptance gate will fail on this exact compile error unless resolved first. Neither fix is authorized within Phase 7's locked D-06 scope boundary; needs an explicit decision before 07-04 runs testUnit.

The nine follow-ups carried from `v1.2.9_gg4-tests` are out of scope for this milestone by explicit decision — see `REQUIREMENTS.md` → Future Requirements. Two (client-V2 error classification, `Map(K, Nullable(V))`) close for free and are recorded, not worked (FREE-01, FREE-02).
